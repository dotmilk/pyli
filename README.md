pyle is a lexer for Python that I wrote from scratch. You can run it with:

    cabal configure
    cabal build
    ./dist/build/pick-lex/pick-lex

Pick is distributed with an MIT license which basically lets you use it for
almost anything, as long as you keep the license in the project, and don't
take my name off of the stuff I wrote.
